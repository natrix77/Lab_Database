# Mock Images for GitHub Pages

This directory should contain the following mockup images for the GitHub Pages site:

1. `dashboard-mockup.png` - Screenshot of the dashboard page
2. `academic-year-mockup.png` - Screenshot of the academic year management page
3. `teams-mockup.png` - Screenshot of the team assignment page
4. `attendance-mockup.png` - Screenshot of the attendance tracking page
5. `grades-mockup.png` - Screenshot of the grade management page

## How to Create Mockups

1. Run the application locally
2. Take screenshots of each page
3. Resize and optimize the images for web (recommended size: 800x600 pixels)
4. Save the images in this directory with the names listed above

If you don't have actual screenshots, you can create simple mockups using design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.
